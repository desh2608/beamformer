# Souden MVDR beamformer in CuPy

This package is modified from the core parts of [pb_bss](https://github.com/fgnt/pb_bss) 
and modifies it to use [CuPy](https://github.com/cupy/cupy) for accelerated GPU-based inference.

At the moment, it is meant to be used with the [GSS](https://github.com/desh2608/gss) toolkit.
